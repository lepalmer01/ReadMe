# ReadMe Generator

The ReadMe Generator is a command-line application designed to simplify the creation of a polished README.md file for your project. Powered by the Inquirer package, it guides users through prompts, collecting essential information about their application and dynamically populating relevant sections of the README.

## Installation

When you run the application, it will prompt you for information about your project. Enter the required details such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. These details will be added to their respective sections in the generated README.
